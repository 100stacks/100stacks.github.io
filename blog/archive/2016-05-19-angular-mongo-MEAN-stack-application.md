# Angular Mongo MEAN Stack Application

## Where are we going?

The next series of blog post will be geared toward novice developers who are interested in building an
Angular 1.x + MongoDB MEAN stack application.  Although many examples are available across the Internet, 
this series of posts will attempt to bring together many different tutorials.

The first step is to think about what you want to accomplish.  Even a rough sketch will help you as you develop

great thing about this step is that it's cheap!  At this point you do not have any time or code invested, so
making changes are easy.
