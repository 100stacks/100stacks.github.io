# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This site will morph as I try to find different ways to make it more useful, and as a place to gather thoughts that I hope will provide some usefulness to others.

## `travis-ci.org` Deprecated

You may have noticed that newer `TravisCI` builds are being run on `travis-ci.com`, where older (open source repos using `TravisCI` infrastructure prior to May 2018) are still using `travis-ci.org`.
