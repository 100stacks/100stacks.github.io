# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Hello,

This page will change over time as I flush out the best use of this site.  I have published
sample apps and various posts in the pasts.  As my homepage, it will morph as I try to find different ways
to make it more useful, and as a place to gather thoughts that I hope would provide some usefulness
to others.

### Next Steps are to integrate a blog post linking to projects.
